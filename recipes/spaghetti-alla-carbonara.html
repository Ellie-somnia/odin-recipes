    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>Carbonara is a Roman dish made with eggs, hard cheese, and cured pork. Its signature rich and silky sauce comes from beaten eggs tossed with hot pasta. The trick to making carbonara is making sure the pasta is hot enough to cook the eggs, but not so hot that they curdle.</p>
    
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <p><strong>Measurements for 4 servings</strong>.</p>

    <ul>
        <li>1 tbsp olive oil</li>
        <li>1 pound guanciale</li>
        <li>1 package (16 ounce) spaghetti</li>
        <li>3 eggs</li>
        <li>10 tbsp grated pecorino romano or parmesan, if preferred</li>
        <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat; add guanciale. Cook, turning occasionally, until evenly browned and crispy, 5 to 10 minutes. Remove from heat and drain on paper towels.</li>
        <li>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Cook spaghetti in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until tender yet firm to the bite, about 9 minutes. Drain and return to the pot. Let cool, stirring occasionally, about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Whisk eggs, &frac12; of the Pecorino Romano cheese, and some black pepper in a bowl until smooth and creamy.</li>
        <li>Pour egg mixture over pasta, stirring quickly, until creamy and slightly cooled. Stir in guanciale.</li>
            <ul>
                <li><i><strong>Chef's tip:</strong> you can add some of the pasta water as you stirr to get an even creamier result</i>.</li>
            </ul>
        <li>Top with remaining Pecorino Romano cheese and more black pepper before serving.</li>
    </ol>
